Winapt (codenamed "Icehamster") Design Notes
--------------------------------------------

The Mission:
------------

1. Write a tool for developers to create re-usable MS-Windows packages. (a la
.rpm or .deb.)

2. Write a tool that will allow users to install these packages on their 
computers. 

3. Write a tool that will allow users to install or uninstall packages
from the Net or from Media, along with all of their dependencies. 
(a la apt/urpmi/yum)

4. Write a hosting backend management for hosting such packages on remote
servers.

Technologies that will be used:
-------------------------------

1. Perl - http://www.perl.org/ - writing package management and build systems
in C is widely considered a bad idea. (dpkg/apt and rpm are written in C
because they are expected to run on an embedded device in the electricity
cabinet of the ladies restroom in a gas station in Albuquerque.) On a standard
Win32 system we can easily install the Perl run-time without worrying too
much about bloating the system, so there's no reason why we shouldn't use it.

    Why not a different language?
    -----------------------------

    1. I know and like Perl the best, and so I'm going to use what I like.

    2. I think it would be very suitable for this.

    3. There are plenty of good and useful modules in CPAN.

    4. Many programmers know Perl enough to contribute.
    
    5. If you don't like it, write an alterantive with a different 
    language. :-)
    
2. PAR - http://par.perl.org/ - this will allow us to prepare self-contained
packages of Winapt.

Desired Features of the Advanced Version:
-----------------------------------------

(in no particular order)

* Handle installation per-user and global installation.

* Manage registry keys.

* Have the ability to track several major versions of the same program and 
install them all at once.

* Seemless upgrade of packages.

* Install new packages easily.

* Resolve dependencies.

* No (!!) file dependencies.
