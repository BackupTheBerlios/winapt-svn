Introduction:
-------------

This is a functional spec for Winapt, which is a package management system
for Win32, similar to such systems for UNIX-like systems (e.g: Debian's 
apt-get/dpkg, RedHat's rpm/yum, Mandriva's rpm/urpmi, smart or
Gentoo's portage).

Scenario 1: "We Want Free Stuff":
---------------------------------

Millie is a young fox girl who likes to use Windows XP, and still haven't
gotten around to install Linux. However, she is tired of keeping up with
the various open-source and non-open-source software she has on her computer:
Inkscape, eMule, Firefox, Thunderbird, Paint Shop Pro, etc. At one point
her geek friend Stefan the Aardvark (who is a die-hard Linux user) recommends 
her to install Winapt, so she can manage her software.

She browses to the winapt site, downloads the installer, accepts the EULA,
and installs the software. Then she starts the dialog which downloads the
updated remote-sources lists and then packages lists. It detects which
software is installed on her computer, and automatically upgrades it. Then
it gives her a long list of other software.

Millie installs the "Pink Flamingo Bathtub Game", the "Tomboy Tomboy edition"
note taker, the "Burn ants burn" real-life simulator, and a game to put
electronic needles on Ayn Rand's face. She goes to sleep happy.

The next day when she wakes up, Winapt informs her that she has updates for
her software, and allows her to upgrade.
